# V-EZ

V-EZ is a light-weight middleware layer for the Vulkan API that lowers the barrier to entry for developers. The required low-level knowledge of GPU hardware and behavior in Vulkan is much greater than previous graphics APIs.  V-EZ attempts to bridge that gap by augmenting the Vulkan API to allow for traditional usage and semantics while retaining the power and flexibility afforded by Vulkan.
